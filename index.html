    <p class="more-info">
      Croissants are a style of viennoiserie pastries, which of course relates
      back to the Austrian city of Vienna, otherwise known as the birthplace of
      croissants. The ancestor to the modern-day croissant was called the
      kipferl, which dates back to the 13th century and comes in various shapes
      and sizes.
